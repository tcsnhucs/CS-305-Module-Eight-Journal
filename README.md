Artemis Financial is a financial firm that manages data for a large amount of customers, and needed to create software to safely handle this data, and encrypt/decrypt it in order to ensure proper security, and safe personal data storage practices. When I began working on the software, there was already a somewhat premade version of the software that I was given to start with, which had several vulnerabilities. In order to solve these vulnerabilities, I mostly just had to update the dependancies in the software to the latest version in order to get rid of any vulnerabilities, it wasn't particularly challenging and made the software a lot less vulnerable. The software also had no encryption layer involved before I started working with it, so I made it so the software encrytped all input data with the SHA-256 Encryption standard. I then tested the code and ensured that with a Maven check there were no vulnerabilites, which made the program much more secure, and safe to use, as well as ensuring the costomer data that was handled by Artemis Financial was safe and secure. I do not beleive that I would show future employees anything from this assignment however, due to how relatively simple in scope it was, as it mostly just tought concepts and ensured I knew how to use them.
